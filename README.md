# Week10-FINAL-Levitia

Proposal:
**Bloom** - Habit & Mood Tracker

The focus of the project would primiarily be on the UI and UX of the app. The overall theme would be playful, approachable and hopefully intuitive to use. 

Features:
- Users can choose their mood and hopefully other selections (e.g. weather, activities) for that day
- Add notes/ diary to it if they opt to
- Users can see their mood flow in a calendary-like view
- (If i have more time) Users can see the statistics and analyze their mood
